DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword

BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher

SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=5000

PUSHER_APP_ID=yourappid
PUSHER_APP_KEY=yourkey
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=yoursecret
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=yourregion

MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
```
2) Change discordV3/utils/database.json to your database credentials.
4) Move to the PhpSide directory
5) Create the empty database with the `DB_DATABASE` used on the .env file.
6) Run the following command:
```
$ composer install
